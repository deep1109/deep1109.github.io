    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Theory is a set of interrelated propositions about constructs. Theories are conceptual frameworks that aid in organizing and predicting phenomena. Again, just as everyone collects data, both lay persons and researchers have theories. According to McGuire (1980), formal theories &ldquo;are distinguished from ordinary thought by the use of more explicit definitions and more abstract and more formally interrelated principles&rdquo; (p. 53). Theories vary in their specificity and their units of analysis. Deutsch and Krauss illustrate this through the metaphor of a net.
Theory is a net man weaves to catch the world of observationâ€”to explain, predict, and influence it. The theorists &hellip; have woven nets of different sorts. Some are all-purpose nets meant to catch many species of behavior, others are clearly limited to a few species; some have been constructed for use near the surface, others work best in the depths.</p>

<p>Their analogy illustrates that the utility, meaningfulness, and validity of a theory will depend upon its application and frame of reference. Shaw and Costanzo (1982) identify three characteristics that they consider necessary in the evaluation of the quality of a theory:</p>

<pre><code>Logical and internal consistency;
Agreement with known data;
Testability.
</code></pre>
